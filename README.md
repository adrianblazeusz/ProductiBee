# ProductiBee: Boost Your Productivity
ProductiBee is a (demo) application designed to enhance your productivity while using a computer. Choose the websites and desktop apps that distract you, and ProductiBee will keep them at bay, allowing you to focus on what truly matters. And after the specified time, you will receive information on how you spent this period.

## Features
### 1. Selective Blocking
Stay in Control: With ProductiBee, you're in the driver's seat. Choose the websites and apps that tend to divert your attention, and let the application handle the rest. Whether it's social media, news websites, or any other distractions, ProductiBee ensures they don't interfere with your workflow.

### 2. Time analysis
Take a deep dive into your habits: it's not just about blocking out distractions; it's about understanding them. ProductiBee offers analytics on how you spend your time across different apps and websites. With these insights, you can make informed decisions about managing your digital habits.

### 3. Unlock information
Post-Session Conclusion: After the ProductiBee work session is over, it doesn't stop there. Provides reports on usage patterns, helping to identify areas for improvement.

### Demo
The application is only in the early stages of development and there is still much to be developed. If you like this idea and you are willing to create applications together, **I encourage you to make commits.**

## Plans for the future

 - create a website blocker that is more tailored to different sites
 - improved blocker operation: the program will block websites even after closing the application
 - Improved application selection: instead of saving applications manually, the program will load the list of applications on the computer.
 - Improvement of work analysis: better tuned time analysis on the computer as well as the addition of graphs with different time dimensions.
 - To-do list tab: creating a tab where the user will be able to enter their tasks, as well as include tools that will help them (this function will be used to create a more refined productivity analysis)
